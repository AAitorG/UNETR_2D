# UNETR_2D
2D UNETR implementation in Tensorflow 2.-keras, for EM image segmentation.

You can easily test it using [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AAitorG/UNETR_2D/blob/main/quickstart.ipynb). The default parameters used in the notebook correspond to UNETR-2D Mini. Although the best hyperparameters have not been selected, due to the high time consumption, another configuration has been selected that makes use of OneCycle and fewer epochs, which is faster, and also achieves very good results.
